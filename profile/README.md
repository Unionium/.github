# Unionium 🚀  

*Unionium is a non-profit organization, the essence of which is to make just cool and at the same time useful things that are free. We consider importance and openness.*

---

## 📌 About Us  
- *Initially, Unionium was conceived as just a messenger, just for ordinary communication, but with its own features. I knew that popular messengers were listening to us, and I was not pleased to understand this. We all live, and our life is our life, no one should have the right to it. This is how Unionium was born, a project that seeks to protect the data of users, and basically everyone.*
- *This project was to be managed by an organization, and Unionium NCO was born.*
- *So far, this is all formal, since work on the messenger is done very slowly, and this is our main product.*
- *You can help our team develop it, but there are some conditions:* 
1. No Signal Protocol, Matrix, and more.
2. Everything should be clear (and not like Matrix, which is mainly for geeks)
3. Resistance to restrictions from states.
4. If you make absolutely any contribution, you will become a Contributor (freedom comes first, so if you have the knowledge and aspiration, we will be happy to welcome you)
